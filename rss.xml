            <title><![CDATA[In 1998 I went to Antarctica.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In 1998 I went to Antarctica.</h1><p>Why? Fair question. I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I wanted to hear the silence calling[1], to paraphrase Douglas Mawson. I wanted to gaze upon the vast white vistas at the seat of the world.

Actually, no. That’s a bit melodramatic and it wasn’t really like that. It was achingly practical. Antarctica didn’t “call” to me across the Southern Ocean. There is no explorer DNA hardcoded into my genes. But, as the name suggests, Antarctica is where Antarctic krill live, and I should really see where they hang out if I wanted to study them, which I did. And bring a few back, of course. But on top of all that, I did want to go. Not a life’s ambition, not the realisation of a dream. But an opportunity not to be missed.

It was 1998, the first time. I was a little while into a PhD project looking at Antarctic krill. Krill are basically whale food; shrimp-like crustaceans that drift around the Southern Ocean, mostly getting caught in baleen and guzzled down by sea birds. They’re a keystone species, meaning they eat pretty much anything smaller than they are, and get eaten by anything larger. I was interested in whether the hole in the ozone layer (remember that?) could harm krill populations. Short answer? The krill are fine. But I needed to do a lot of experiments, and they needed krill. And I couldn’t get them at the pet store.

So of I went, congenitally naïve and uncharacteristically ready for adventure. And this, along with about old school 35mm Kodachrome 500 slides, lots of Emails and a crate full of memories, is the result. I kept a diary[2] every day, a record of what I did and what I had done to me, what I saw, what I heard, tasted, felt. What I experienced.

I hope it is of some interest.</p></article>]]></description>
