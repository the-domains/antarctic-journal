In 1998 and 1999 I went to Antarctica to catch krill for my PhD project. I was studying if ultraviolet radiation from the ozone hole (remember that?) effects Antarctic krill. I'll save you the bother of reading my thesis: the krill are fine.

I kept a diary of my entire PhD, including two voyages to Antarctica, plus one attempted voyage that turned round within 24 hours after the engine caught fire. But more on that later.
I'm putting the diary of my trips online, maybe with a few photos, for no other reason that it was a fantastic experience and I'm keen to share it.
All the best,
Krillboy.
