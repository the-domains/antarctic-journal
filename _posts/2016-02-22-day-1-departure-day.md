NOTE: Sorry about all the footnotes. Future entries will not be so densely annotated.\] 

Got up almost immediately and showered, and made last-minute checks. Got to the ship about 8:30am and met So\[1\] carrying a huge monitor. Got a bit lost on my way down to my cabin - a four-berth quite forward, on the port side, and thankfully with a porthole. Saw Simon J and we pondered the fact that our cage pallets were still on the dockside. But they still seemed confident of leaving at 5pm.

We had a safety drill, with life jackets and the big orange capsule-shaped lifeboats that put me in mind of some Vitamin C. Rather sobering to consider that these bulbous lifeboats would be our lifeline if the ship, the RSV Aurora Australis, came to some unspecified harm. I got the sense that piling into the lifeboat in Antarctic waters would be merely delaying the inevitable\[2\].
Talking us through the lifeboats onboard comforts or lack thereof was the 3rd mate, Les, a very pukka Englishman. We all got out and wandered back to the boat for an instructional video. After that, we were on our own. I gave Simon J a lift into town then went home to get some more footwear and eat something. I burst into Fraggle Rock\[3\], walked past Lev's door and said; "I'm back! Gee, it was cold!" Freaked him slightly.
Called in at Uni to drop off a tuner and Dan and I went to lunch at Knopwood's and drank beers for a while. Ang\[4\] and Richard turned up. Richard was being... Richard, I suppose, and pissing off Dan something chronic (at one stage I asked him to just "stop being Richard" for a minute). We eventually got back to the boat where people were waiting, including my family, including Simon\[5\]. And of course, they mistook Dan\[6\] for Danni\[7\], something that has only just stopped happening.
I was unsure of whether we could go on the boat, but as soon as I saw Andrew Mac's family following him around the deck, we all went on a bit of a tour courtesy of Steve Reeve of the shipping and air operations section. A very nice fellow. Richard and Simon were dueling wise cracks. I tried to hang near the back and avoid the flying testosterone. Dan was really hyped about being on the Aurora. "Oh wow, I'm on the Aurora!" I really hope my photos come out. The rest of them went off somewhere but by this time Rob King\[8\] had turned up and I needed to bend his ear.
So Dan hung around for a bit while I found out what was happening. Seems departure was delayed until 7, then 9\. Dan and I walked back along the port side deck and she said; "Isn't that Vicki\[9\]?" "Yes," I said, "and I do believe that's Danni next to her."
I was so happy to see her. I really thought that she wouldn't come along, and it was only by a hair's breadth that she didn't give up and go home. We decided to walk back to Knopwood's together, while Vicki and Dan drove. As we did she persuaded me to ring my Mum and Dad to tell them that departure had been delayed until 9\.
We got to the pub and had a drink while waiting for Niall\[10\]. Simon showed up again and bought me a beer, and soon Tash, Dave and Serena King \[Rob's wife\] showed up. Gradually they filtered away until Niall arrived. Then it was Danni and I, Niall, Vicki and Serena. Danni and I were very involved with each other, but not too antisocial.
It was a bit of a stressful evening, actually. Vicki, Serena and Niall decided, as we did, to go to Mure's for something to eat. Danni and I started walking, but it wasn't until ten metres from Mure's that I realised I'd left my backpack, with a camera, two lenses and heaps of film, not to mention some cash and my passport, outside Knopwood's. I sprinted back and didn't find it there, so I looked around for Niall etc. hoping they'd picked it up. No Niall.
I ran back to Danni, completely breathless, and decided to go to Mure's to see if they picked it up. I saw Mark Risdon in the Mako fish bar and asked him if he'd seen my pack. Yes, he said, and I kissed him on his big bald head.
So it became a bit of a running gag for the evening. "So what else have you forgotten?" I didn't forget a copy of ThylaXene\[11\] - but ultimately I should have brought more long-sleeved shirts and an alarm clock.
We left on amended schedule at 9:00, with my family and Danni waving. I hugged everybody but left Danni until last. I wandered away towards the gangplank and hung around. Then when it seemed I had jumped the gun, I went back to Danni and she kissed me on the cheek. And up the slippery aluminium gangplank I went.
I climbed aboard full of adrenaline and found a good spot near Karen and Simon and Fiona. Danni was standing well back from the crowd, not talking very much. She was so far away I couldn't read her expression.
(Another silly thing happened when I departed - I gave Danni the stuffed seal earlier on, then carried it around in my pack for her. Then, of course, I board the damned boat with it still in my pack! Since she was standing well back, I had to lob the thing towards my Dad with the yelled instructions "Dad! Give this to Danni!" It must have looked quite dramatic, but unintentionally so.)
Leaving was a big buzz, and Hobart is stunning at night from a boat. Possibly it's a view that few people see. People started the traditional stringing of streamers from ship to those waiting on shore. This was new to me, I had no idea that the shore people had to hang onto them. I think I cheated by tying mine to the handrail, possibly opening myself up for nautical bad luck.
Hobart seemed to pull away much slower than I expected -- not exactly warp speed. Simon and I stood out the back of the helideck and started to talk to various other expeditioners. Annie Wong and Karen were early targets of our inquisitiveness. Annie is a "dotzapper", keeping marine science data clean and tidy. Karen is a "birdo", or bird observer. Karen's first voyage, so at least Simon and I are not alone in this aspect.

* \[2\] A few weeks previously I had picked up a bag of cold weather gear issued to me by ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions). The Antarctic Division's storeman, Don, explained the utility of the Stormy Seas, a bright red insulated jacket for wearing on deck, that self-inflated in the event of going overboard. Don explained that it's primary purpose would be the quick recovery of my bobbing, frozen corpse from the freezing water.
