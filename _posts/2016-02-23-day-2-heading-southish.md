My cabin has four bunks and must get very crowded when full. Until we pick people up from the bases I'll have it to myself.
Went to breakfast and talked to Karen the trawl-person. I'm putting the word out about what I'm trying to do in my PhD. People seem interested. Breakfast is a very elaborate affair. The menu is very full and all of it is just perfect. I've heard a lot about the Aurora cooks and it's all true. Could gain a bit of weight here. Although there is a gym onboard I could not by any stretch of a fevered imagination be referred to as a gym person.

Went up on the bridge and saw exactly how inhospitable this part of the world is. Dick\[1\] was up there too, trying to organise some fishing later on. There's going to be a course correction in a little while -- I'll wait until after that. I don't like to pester him, but at some stage I'll have to.

Karen's plastic net is a 1mm mesh that is towed at 3 knots. Too quick for live animals, but it will pick them up. The top 1m is of special interest to me for UV purposes. If I can piggy-back Karen's collecting in return for assistance, it all seems very serendipitous.
They're doing some trawling now. It looks like a hideously complex operation, dropping a MIDOC net opening it at different depths to sample the water column.

I'll try and approach Dick re: science and Andrew\[2\] re: the krill room. The boat was rolling a little but not much compared to later on. Poor Fiona had to be helped, staggering from the trawl deck mezzanine, looking paler than I've ever seen a human being look.
I got hold of Andrew re: the krill room, and now it's chilling down (hopefully) and all the tanks are accessible. I'll drain and clean them out soon, but I really must get rid of that floor drain.
